# Chronicles of Stampadia

A daily print-and-play roguelike adventure you can play offline.

### Bugs

- [ ] on `play.html` tokens are not placed in the right position when the page is opened and the sheet is not fully visible

### Ideas - Misc

- [ ] i18n
  - Challenge: Descriptions must be still oneliners and fit the _Rooms Table_
  - Challenge: New contents must be always translated in order to generate the same adventure sheet every day
  - Suggestion: Prototype a version with a translated `database` folder and then think about a slim i18n system

### Ideas - Print

- [ ] Larger text in _Rooms Table_
  - Challenge: How we can make the _Rooms Table_ larger?
  - Challenge: How we can make the _Rooms Table_ taller?
- [ ] Larger _Hero Sheet_ and _Enemy Sheet_ boxes, in order to fit a dice more nicely
  - Challenge: How we can make the sheets larger?
  - Challenge: How we can make the sheets taller?
  - Suggestion: Export the an adventure sheet using `debug.html` and prototype alternate sheets on Inkscape

### Ideas - Gameplay

- [ ] Use >= and <= for ranges in hero sheet
- [ ] Items/attacks using exact range values
  - [ ] Good/weak atk depending on range
- [ ] New classes
  - [ ] Tank/Dwarf - Instead of having a Move action in the first column, make it DEF -2. In other words, instead of running away to get away from attacks, the character just takes the attacks, but defends against them.
  - [ ] Rogue - Get gold by fights
- [ ] New quests
  - [ ] Exchange xp/hp
  - [ ] Use luck/unluck more
  - [Â ] The messenger - bring messages between quests
- [ ] NPC
  - [ ] The Corrupted
